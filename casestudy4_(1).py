# Data Exploration and Preprocessing

## Introduction
This python notebook focuses on data exploration for building a credit scoring model to classify applicants as "good" or "bad". The dataset consists of credit card applications (600,000_ rows, 18 features) and corresponding credit records.

## Data Exploration

#### Overview (After Data Exploration and Cleaning)
Applications Dataset
This part of the dataset contains demographic and financial information about the applicants. Notable features include:
- Gender: Encoded as 1 for male, 0 for female
- Own_car and Own_property: Binary indicators (1 for yes, 0 for no)
- Total_income: Applicant's income
- Age: Calculated from DAYS_BIRTH
- Years_employed: Calculated from DAYS_EMPLOYED
- Education_type: Level of education
- Family_status: Marital status
- Housing_type: Type of residence
- Occupation_type: Job category
- Target: Binary indicator for credit card approval (1 for approved, 0 for denied)

Credit Records Dataset
This section of the data provides details about the applicants' credit card usage and payment behavior. Key features include:
- ID: Unique identifier for each applicant
- MONTHS_BALANCE: Number of months of balance information
- STATUS: Credit card status (e.g., 'C' for current)

#### Observations
- Missing Values were present in both datasets.
- Credit Records Dataset had a significant imbalance between "good" and "bad" credit standing.
- Applications Dataset had a mix of continuous and categorical variables.
- Numeric features exhibit skewed distributions.
- Correlation analysis revealed multicollinearity among some features.
- Income and Employment: The dataset includes information on total income and years of employment, which are likely significant factors in credit card approval decisions
- Education and Occupation: Higher education levels and certain occupation types may correlate with higher approval rates
- Family Status and Housing: The applicant's marital status and type of residence are recorded, potentially influencing the credit risk assessment
- Credit History: The MONTHS_BALANCE and STATUS fields suggest that the applicant's credit history and payment behavior are tracked over time
- Demographics: Age and gender information is available, allowing for analysis of potential demographic trends in credit card approvals

#### Visualizations
- Histograms and density plots for continuous variables to understand distribution shapes.
- Correlation Heatmaps to highlight the relationships between the variables.
- Good vs Bad Applicants showed class imbalance in the target variable

"""### Observations

#### Distribution Analysis

The histogram shows the distribution of account lengths for credit card holders, revealing several key insights:

**Peak Distribution**
The highest frequency occurs around the 40-month mark, with approximately 38,000 accounts. This suggests that many customers have maintained their accounts for about 3.5 years.

**Account Length Patterns**
- A steady increase in frequency from 0 to 20 months, indicating consistent new account acquisition
- A relatively stable plateau between 25-35 months
- A notable peak at 40 months followed by a gradual decline
- An interesting spike at the 60-month mark, suggesting a significant number of long-term account holders

**Customer Retention**
The distribution shape indicates strong customer retention with many accounts lasting beyond 30 months. The gradual decline after 40 months rather than a sharp drop-off suggests successful long-term customer relationships.

#### Account Characteristics

From the dataset, accounts show diverse characteristics:

**Demographics**
- Mix of male and female cardholders
- Various education levels, from secondary to higher education
- Different housing situations, including owned properties and rented apartments
- Multiple income types, including working professionals and commercial associates

**Financial Indicators**
- Income ranges vary significantly, from 112,500 to 427,500 in the sample
- Employment duration is tracked and varies considerably among cardholders
- Multiple occupation types are represented, including laborers, security staff, and sales personnel

The data suggests a comprehensive credit card program that serves a diverse customer base with varying financial profiles and account tenures.

#### Insights

- This feature is expected to play a significant role in the predictive model as it reflects the duration of financial activity.
- Longer durations may indicate higher exposure to potential risks, but they may also reflect responsible credit usage for low-risk users

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Continuous Features Engineering

To enhance the dataset, i have derived additional continuous features that provide meaningful insights into customers’ profiles, such as their age, employment history, and employment status.

#### Workings:
Age
- Converted DAYS_BIRTH (number of days since birth, negative values) into years by dividing by 365.2425 (accounting for leap years).
- Removed the original DAYS_BIRTH column to avoid redundancy.

UNEMPLOYED
- Created a binary feature (UNEMPLOYED) to flag users with no recorded employment history.
- Users with negative DAYS_EMPLOYED values (indicating valid employment history) were marked as 0 (not unemployed).
- All others were marked as 1 (unemployed).

EMPLOYED
- Converted DAYS_EMPLOYED into years using the same factor (365.2425).
- Ensured non-negative values:
Replaced negative employment years with 0 to handle cases where users were marked with invalid or missing data.
- Removed the original DAYS_EMPLOYED column after processing.
